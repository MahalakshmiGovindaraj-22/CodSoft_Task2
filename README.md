# Colorful Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This project is a GUI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player competes against an unbeatable AI.  
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal decisions, and the application includes a colorful user interface, a scoreboard, a restart option, and sound effects.

## Features
- Unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm
- Colorful and interactive graphical user interface using Tkinter
- Scoreboard to track player wins, AI wins, and draws
- Restart game option
- Sound effects for moves and game outcomes
- Human vs AI gameplay

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter for GUI development
- Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making
- Game theory and search algorithms
- winsound module for sound effects (Windows)

## How the AI Works
The AI is implemented using the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm from game theory.  
It evaluates all possible future game states and selects the optimal move, ensuring that the AI never loses and can only win or draw.
